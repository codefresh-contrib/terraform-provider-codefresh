# codefresh_abac_rules (Resource)

Gitops Abac Rules are used to setup access control and allow to define which teams have access to which resources based on tags and attributes.

See the [Access Control documentation](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/administration/account-user-management/access-control/).

## Example usage

```hcl
resource "codefresh_team" "developers" {
  name = "developers"

  users = [
      "5efc3cb6355c6647041b6e49",
      "59009221c102763beda7cf04"
    ]
}

resource "codefresh_abac_rules" "app_rule" {
  entity_type = "gitopsApplications"
  teams       = [data.codefresh_team.developers.id]
  actions     = ["REFRESH", "SYNC", "TERMINATE_SYNC", "APP_ROLLBACK"]

  attribute {
    name = "LABEL"
    key = "KEY"
    value = "VALUE"
  }
}

```
