Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect

The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI
configuration:
 - codefresh-io/codefresh in /Users/yonatankoren/software/codefresh-io/tofu-provider-codefresh

The behavior may therefore not match any released version of the provider and
applying changes may cause the state to become incompatible with published
releases.

OpenTofu used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

OpenTofu will perform the following actions:

  # module.test.codefresh_context.azure["create"] will be created
  + resource "codefresh_context" "azure" {
      + id   = (known after apply)
      + name = "azure"

      + spec {
          + storageazuref {

                      + account_name = "accName"
                      + type         = "basic"
                    }
                }
            }
