Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect

The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI
configuration:
 - codefresh-io/codefresh in /Users/yonatankoren/software/codefresh-io/tofu-provider-codefresh

The behavior may therefore not match any released version of the provider and
applying changes may cause the state to become incompatible with published
releases.

module.test.data.codefresh_team.users: Read complete after xs [id=64050eece8e7a480941d22b2]

OpenTofu used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

OpenTofu will perform the following actions:

  # module.test.codefresh_abac_rules.app_rule will be created
  + resource "codefresh_abac_rules" "app_rule" {
      + actions     = [
          + "APP_ROLLBACK",
          + "REFRESH",
          + "SYNC",
          + "TERMINATE_SYNC",
          + "VIEW_POD_LOGS",
        ]
      + entity_type = "gitopsApplications"
      + id          = (known after apply)
      + tags        = [
          + "dev",
          + "untagged",
        ]
      + teams       = [
          + "64050eece8e7a480941d22b2",
        ]

      + attribute {
          + key   = "KEY"
          + name  = "LABEL"
          + value = "VALUE"
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
